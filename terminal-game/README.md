1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Kai-972/Tech-Explore/releases)
2. Download the appropriate file for your system:
   - `asteroid-dodger-linux-x64` (Linux 64-bit)
   - `asteroid-dodger-macos` (macOS)
   - `asteroid-dodger-windows.exe` (Windows with WSL/terminal)
3. Make it executable (Linux/macOS): `chmod +x asteroid-dodger-*`
4. Run: `./asteroid-dodger-*` or double-click on Windows

### Option 2: One-Line Install Script

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kai-972/Tech-Explore/main/terminal-game/install.sh | bash
```

**Or download and run:**
```bash
wget https://github.com/Kai-972/Tech-Explore/releases/latest/download/asteroid-dodger-linux-x64
chmod +x asteroid-dodger-linux-x64
./asteroid-dodger-linux-x64
```

### Option 3: Build from Source

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential libncurses5-dev

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S base-devel ncurses

# macOS
brew install ncurses

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install gcc-c++ ncurses-devel
```

**Build and Run:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kai-972/Tech-Explore.git
cd Tech-Explore/terminal-game
make
./bin/main
```

## üéÆ How to Play

### Controls
- **Movement**: `W` `A` `S` `D` or Arrow Keys
- **Quit**: `Q` at any time
- **Restart**: `R` after game over

### Objective
Pilot your ship (`o`) through the asteroid field, avoiding the dangerous asteroids (`*`) while collecting points for survival time. The longer you survive, the higher your score!

### Tips
- Watch the animated thruster behind your ship
- Stars (`.`) are just background - they won't hurt you
- Asteroids spawn more frequently as time goes on
- Your ship has "wings" (`<o>`) - the entire ship can collide with asteroids

- **Graphics Library**: ncurses
- **Platform Support**: Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL/Cygwin)
- **Memory Usage**: < 5MB
- **Terminal Requirements**: 80x24 minimum, color support recommended
